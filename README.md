# hello-world
Creating a repository for CSCI-12 to learn how this all fits together. 
# Hi I'm Mary #
## I would love to be able to make changes to my website, BelmontPorchfest.org, using HTML, CSS and PHP ##
1. I'd like to add a user name and password so people only have to enter their information once, not annually
2. I'd like to have a map that allows people to navigate from the porch that are on to a new one
3. And lots more
   
# but all of this would probably drive my webguy nuts ...
### I'm taking classes this semester to learn these skills ###
*I'm afraid I am going to bomb out!*
