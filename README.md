# hello-world
Creating a repository for CSCI-12 to learn how this all fits together. 
# Hi I'm Mary #
## I would love to be able to make changes to my website using HTML, CSS and PHP ##
1. I'd like to add a user name and password so people only have to enter their informatoin once, not annually
2. I'd like to have a map that allows people to have directions
3. And lots more
4. but all of this would probably drive my webguy nuts ..,
### I'm taking classes this semester to learn these skills ###
* I'm afraid I am going to bomb out!*
